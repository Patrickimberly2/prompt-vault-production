# Understanding Your Communication Style

### FILL-IN-THE-BLANK **PROMPTS:**

```jsx
As a CEO, I tend to be **[direct/aggressive/conflict-averse]** when I'm communicating my ideas to my team, but I need to be more **[diplomatic/assertive/direct]** when I lead. 

Can you give me a brief walkthrough to change my communication style to the one that I  want?
```

```jsx
Taking into account both my own insights and feedback from others, I have identified my main strengths as **[strength 1, strength 2, and strength 3]**, and my main weaknesses as **[weakness 1, weakness 2, and weakness 3]**. 

Help me understand the best ways to communicate with others while leveraging my strengths and minimizing my weaknesses.
```

```jsx
I need to talk to my team members about **[specific topic]**, and I want to ensure that my message **[describe the message]** is effectively communicated.

My communication style tends to be more **[passive/aggressive]**. and I need help to ensure that my message is articulate, assertive, and effective.

Guide me through a step-by-step process to improve my communication skills. Provide an example of how I can apply this to the message I want to convey to my team.
```
