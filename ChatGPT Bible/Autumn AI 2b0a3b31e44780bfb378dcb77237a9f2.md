column 4: Measure burnout and prevent it, without surveys. Autumn connects with the tools you already use, leveraging AI to help you identify early signs of burnout and pick up on patterns like increasing meetings, less frequent 1:1s, or more messages on weekends, across your team. And it's not just data – Autumn helps you take action too! Get 1:1 question prompts delivered before every 1:1, tailored to your team so you don't have to wonder if you're asking the right questions. Team insights are delivered to you weekly and help your team feel connected with no extra effort (or another Zoom social) through fun and interactive weekly summaries in Slack.
