them effectively.

```jsx
My customers often **[action, e.g., “leave reviews after a purchase”]**. Write an 
email thanking them and encouraging further interaction with **[next action, 
e.g., “sharing their review on social media”]**.
```

```jsx
Customers who haven’t interacted with my emails for **[time frame]** should 
receive a re-engagement email with a **[special offer/content type]**. Create a 
draft for this email.
