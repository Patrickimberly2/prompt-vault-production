### PROMPTS FOR THE NEW THREADS APP

Threads is a new and exciting app that brings people together through short messages and engaging conversations. This standalone platform, released by Meta, serves as a direct competitor to Twitter and acts as an online hub connected to Instagram, requiring users to have an Instagram account for sign-up.

Please note that ChatGPT may not yet be fully adapted to the unique features and functionalities of the Threads app. As of its last training update in September 2021, ChatGPT does not possess specific knowledge about Threads, which launched in July 2023.

Nonetheless, we have designed our prompts to be versatile and to work even in situations where ChatGPT might not have direct knowledge of the app.
