*Give Superpowers to Your ChatGPT Account*

● **AI Tool**: ChatGPT

**1. How to make ChatGPT more creative**

Something most ChatGPT users ignore is actually what makes it super powerful. **ChatGPT parameters.**

More specifically, to give your ChatGPT superpowers you need to know about three fundamental parameters: temperature, diversity_penalty, and best_of.

There would be a long list of parameters:

NUCLEAR AI FILES 4 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image3%206.png)

But for now it’s important for you to focus on these three:

**a) temperature**

Typically ranging from 0 to 1. It affects the randomness of the model’s output. A higher value results in more diverse outputs. A lower value makes the output more deterministic and focused.

● Low temperature (0-0.3): focused, consistent, conservative outputs.

● Medium temperature (0.3-0.7): balanced creativity and coherence/consistency.

● High temperature (0.7-1): highly creative and diverse, maybe less coherent.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 5 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

For example, when editing books, it is often preferable to set a low temperature in order to maintain consistency rather than excessive creativity in the writing style and content.

**b) diversity_penalty**

Typically ranging from 0 to 2. It encourages the model to produce a diverse set of responses by penalising repeated tokens.

● low diversity penalty (0): no penalty applied, might have repetitive phrases.

● medium diversity penalty (1): balance between diversity and coherence.

● high diversity penalty (2): maximum diversity, might affect coherence. It will try to invent new ways of thinking.

For example, when using ChatGPT to reformat large text for articles and books, it is often necessary to reduce the occurrence of repetitive phrases.

**c) best_of**

The range can include any positive number. It instructs the model to generate a specified number of responses and return the best one according to its internal scoring. By iterating and connecting data, the aim is to produce acceptable or optimal cases of data that align with user expectations.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 6 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

 **Implementation of Parameters**

**Prompt:**

temperature=**[desired number]**

diversity_penalty=**[desired number]**

best_of=**[desired number]**

Suggest me **[input].**

---

**Example 1**:

temperature=**1**

diversity_penalty=**2**

best_of=**5000**

Suggest me **names of blogs for horse caring for horses that have 3 legs.**

ChatGPT responds with more creativity as a result of all the parameters at a high level.

![](image4%206.png)

**Example 2**:

ChatGPT responds with more creativity as a result of all the parameters at a low level.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 7 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image5%206.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 8 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**Example 3**:

This example shows that the higher the level of parameters are, the higher the creativity and diversity of the response.

![](image6%206.png)

Now, let’s go deeper and **test one of the other parameters on the list.**

I chose the **‘presence_penalty’ paramete**r.

Basically, **this parameter controls how creative or focused the output of the model is**.

When the ‘presence_penalty’ is set to a low value (for instance 0.2), the model tends to be more creative and generates responses that may be more imaginative. It allows the model to come up with new and unique ideas, and the responses might be less predictable.

On the other hand, when the ‘presence_penalty’ is set to a high value (for instance 0.9), the model generates responses that are more predictable. It decreases the model's creativity level and makes the output more precise and on-point.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 9 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

In simple terms, a low ‘presence_penalty’ lets the model think outside the box, while a high ‘presence_penalty’ keeps the model more focused and responses are more reliable and consistent.

My team and I ran some tests with the **presence_penalty parameter** on ChatGPT 3.5 (the free version of ChatGPT). And today I am going to share what we found.

Here is the comparison of the three example prompts I am about to show you: one with no requests about presence_penalty, one with low presence_penalty, one with high presence_penalty.

Let’s begin.

So… who won?

NUCLEAR AI FILES 14 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

It’s pretty clear that output #1 and #2 (no presence_penalty and presence_penalty at 0.2) are more creative and high-quality compared to output #3 (presence_penalty at 0.9).

The quality and creativity between #1 and #2 is not that different, though. There *is* a difference, but is not game-changing (in this example, at least).

So **the takeaway here** is that the best thing to do is probably to keep this parameter in your toolbox when you use ChatGPT, especially when writing a normal prompt doesn’t deliver a satisfying output.

Sometimes including this parameter in your prompts can help you substantially with a better output, while sometimes you will get just a very good answer from ChatGPT.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 15 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**2. Rarely used ChatGPT functions**

In this section I want to give insights about some cool ChatGPT tricks that are rarely used, but that will improve your results.

I want to walk you through **4 rarely used ChatGPT functions and implementations** that you can use starting today in any task. I’ll also give you examples for practical situations.

Let’s begin! 😎

Let’s start with number 1:

**1. MAX TOKENS**

The ‘max tokens’ parameter limits the length of the response by specifying the maximum number of tokens it can generate. This is very useful especially in copy and content. When we want a catchy line or a summary that fits within a specific word count, we can set the maximum tokens to ensure responses hit the mark.

Why can’t we use ‘words’? GPT doesn’t really understand word count, but thinks more in terms of tokens, which is just a different measurement.

Here are some practical examples (apply them after giving a good amount of context to ChatGPT):

● Social Media Posts:

Prompt: "Generate a captivating social media caption for our new product image. Keep it within 50 tokens”

● Ad Copy:

Prompt: "Craft a compelling tagline for my ad. Keep it within 10 tokens for

NUCLEAR AI FILES 16 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

maximum impact."

● Chatbot Response:

Prompt: "Provide a concise answer to the customer's query about our shipping policy. Keep it to 30 tokens or less."

And in case you are wondering, token length doesn't count the same as words, but you don’t have to do any hard work to convert them! Open AI provided us with a simple :

![](image7%205.png)

This way you will know what to ask ChatGPT for in your token limit.

**2. TEXT COMPLETION**

Text completion is another cool feature. It's like having a writing buddy who knows just what to say to complete our sentences or fill in the missing parts. We can use it to generate engaging blog intros, complete dialogue, or assist with writing a

NUCLEAR AI FILES 17 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

compelling email body.

It’s very handy when we are writing our own copy and we get stuck in some sentences and can’t keep going forward.

If you’re up to it, you can also train a ChatGPT chat about your company values, offers and branding, so that when you write emails, posts, etc. you will let it autocomplete many parts.

All you have to do is write inside your prompt: [AI completes the text]. And it will do the rest.

**3. MULTI-TURN CONVERSATIONS**

Want to know a secret principle about ChatGPT and AI? Treat it like an assistant, not like a Google search.

What I mean by that is have a conversation, providing feedback on the answers it gives.

This is effective because the more you structure your AI work in conversations, the more ChatGPT will learn and improve.

This brings me to talking about multi-turn conversations, which can be mostly useful for brainstorming ideas and finding solutions to problems you wouldn’t think of.

Multi-turn conversations simply means to maintain context with a conversation, not just writing one single prompt, but a series of questions, comments and feedback on the answers it gives you. This way your conversation becomes an interactive

dialogue.

Here’s a practical example for a lead generation coaching business:

"I'm a lead generation coach and I want to expand my services. What are some

NUCLEAR AI FILES 18 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

potential areas I can focus on?"

AI: "That's exciting! Let's brainstorm together. Can you tell me more about your current services and target audience?"

"Currently, I offer lead generation strategies for B2B companies targeting the technology sector."

AI: "Great! Building on that, have you considered offering specialised lead generation workshops or webinars tailored specifically for SaaS companies? This could help you establish a niche expertise and attract a highly targeted audience."

"That's an interesting idea! What other areas do you think I could explore?"

AI: "Another potential area to explore is providing lead nurturing and conversion optimization services. Many businesses struggle with converting leads into

customers, so offering guidance on optimising sales funnels and lead nurturing campaigns could be a valuable addition to your services."

"I like that suggestion! What about incorporating LinkedIn lead generation strategies into my coaching?"

AI: "Absolutely! LinkedIn is a powerful platform for B2B lead generation. You could offer personalised coaching on optimising LinkedIn profiles, prospecting strategies, and effective outreach techniques to help your clients generate high-quality leads through this platform."

It can go on as much as you want.

**4. SALES CALLS ANALYSIS & IMPROVEMENT**

ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for analysing sales calls, in multiple ways. First off, through sales calls transcription analysis.

If you train the model to analyse conversation dynamics, identify sales techniques, and extract valuable insights, you will create your personal AI sales coach, which tells you how to improve and optimise conversion rates.

For instance, you can prompt the AI with sales call transcriptions (you can use

NUCLEAR AI FILES 19 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

to transcribe sales calls) and ask it to highlight all the objections raised by customers and suggest effective ways to overcome those.

But it doesn't end here.

You can also improve by simulating sales calls with ChatGPT. Here is the first prompt you can use to start the simulation:

*I am a sales rep for a [niche] business. Today I will simulate a sales call with you. Pretend you are a customer. In this simulation use a colloquial language and act like a [target audience].*

Example:

*I am a sales rep for a lead generation coaching business. Today I will simulate a sales call with you. Pretend you are a customer. In this simulation use a colloquial language and act like a male business owner over 35.*

NUCLEAR AI FILES 20 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**3. Bland output from ChatGPT? Do THIS**

How many times were you unhappy with the output you got from ChatGPT because of the tone and style it used? 🙄

Like in anything with ChatGPT, we have to give specific instructions. If we don’t tell AI *how* to write the output, we will get just generic and bland copy/content.

Plus, it will be *clearly* written by AI. No good!

The solution is using **tone modifiers**.

But wait, what are tone modifiers? After a lot of testing, we saw that when you add a combo of specific adjectives to your input you can manipulate the output.

So all you have to do is add this sentence at the end of your prompt: *Please write the output with a [enter the tone combo] tone.*

Now, let’s see what these tone combos are, shall we? Down below you will find a list of situations where tone modifiers can really help you out.

**1. Formal communications**

When it comes to formal communication, such as business emails, formal reports, and legal documents, the **"professional + straightforward"** tone combo is the best choice. With this combo you establish yourself as a reliable and authoritative voice.

**2. Engaging Sales and Marketing Copy**

If you want to write compelling sales emails, persuasive marketing campaigns, and customer service messages you will have to be engaging, yet professional at the same time. That’s where the **"friendly + professional"** tone combo comes into play.

This combo allows you to connect with your audience on a deeper level, building trust and nurturing long-lasting relationships.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 21 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

When it comes specifically to sales copy, there are also two more tone modifiers to keep in mind: **“persuasive, informal, conversational”** and **“emotionally**

**compelling”**. These are the adjectives that ChatGPT uses to describe good sales copy, so keep them in mind.

**3. Expert opinions**

You have to write a thought leadership article or an industry report? The

**"authoritative + informative"** and **"authoritative + expert"** combos are there to help you. With these combinations your text will help you position you as a go-to resource in your niche.

Of course, depending on the situation you can adjust them. For instance, if you have to speak in a formal presentation, then you may also use the **“authoritative + professional”** combo.

**4. Urgent communications**

For limited-time offers, promotional campaigns, and time-sensitive announcements, the **"urgent + persuasive"** combo will give you great results. By leveraging this tone, your message becomes more compelling to take immediate action.

**5. Social media, blog content and conversations**

Everyone’s tone of voice on blogs and social media is different, but many brands will use a **"casual + conversational"** tone. Unleash your creativity, ignite discussions, and form authentic connections with your audience.

If your goal is to get more engagement, then you can opt for the **“casual + funny”**combo, or even the **“humorous + informal”** combo.

**6. Business proposals and instilling trust**

There are some situations where you need the other person to trust you. Business

NUCLEAR AI FILES 22 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

proposals, investor pitches, conversations with clients… even in sales copy, when your goal is to instil trust. In those cases the **"professional + trustworthy"** tone combo is your golden ticket, because it will help you present your ideas with professionalism and create trust.

**7. Sensitive communications**

Some conversations are very hard. When we don’t know what to say to address sensitive topics, crisis communications, or customer service matters, the **"serious + empathetic"** combo really saves the day. It will help you communicate in the best way possible and demonstrate compassion and sincerity, ensuring the other person feels heard and supported.

**8. Motivational speeches**

Business owners and team managers need to know how to motivate and inspire other people, whether they are clients or team mates. You can help them in their path to success with the **"positive + enthusiastic"** tone. This tone modifier infuses your message with optimism and infectious energy, I’m sure many of you will find it useful!

Test these tone modifiers with ChatGPT and see the magic happen.

**One last suggestion**: do your tests with your tone of voice and find the best combos for you. What I just showed you are the general combos that work on ChatGPT, but your tone of voice is unique, so you will have to find what tone modifiers work best for your messaging, copy and content.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 23 dariuslukas.academy/

**4. Stop wasting time on ChatGPT**

One of the things ChatGPT is here to help us with is **saving more time**.

So if you are using it you are probably already saving a handful of hours every week.

What if we could stop wasting valuable time and make the process even faster?

Seems impossible? Read this section to find the truth. 🔍🕵🏻‍♂️

What you will find out today is 3 ways **you can work better and be more organised inside ChatGPT**, helping you boost your productivity even further.

Let’s begin! 👨🏻‍💻

**1. CREATE YOUR TRAINED AI ASSISTANTS**

If you start a new conversation with ChatGPT every single time you log in to work… you are wasting valuable time.

Because instead of creating new conversations and having to train them each time, you can just continue the convos you already started. The language model will be already trained on that topic or task, and the initial output will be much better.

So **the first step is to ask yourself: what are the 3-10 most recurring tasks you work on every week?**

Once you know that, you can create one conversation for each topic/task. Convo after convo you will have created a trained AI assistant that knows how you write, what you need and what is the best way to respond.

Let’s make an example.

Maybe you are an entrepreneur and you often work on these tasks: strategy, product innovation and speaking to events.

In this case you could create 3-10 convos on ChatGPT, which could be: 1. Company strategy

2. Innovating product A

NUCLEAR AI FILES 24 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

3. Innovating product B

4. Innovating product C

5. Presentation on topic A

6. Presentation on topic B

These AI conversations will function as your AI team that learns from you prompt after prompt.

By doing this you won’t have to write a long initial prompt every single time to train the language model about your company and who you are, because you already did it once… so why should you do it twice?

**2. USE THE FAST LANE OF PROMPTS**

Another way to save time while working on ChatGPT is to be able to write the prompts you write most frequently… faster.

How? There is a tool called that allows you to create shortcuts for anything you want.

Let’s say you are a web developer, and you often use ChatGPT to find bugs inside code.

Instead of writing a prompt like:

*I want to find the bug inside a piece of code. Here is the code you need to analyse:[insert code here]*

You could set up a shortcut where you just have to write:

And the whole prompt will appear in front of your eyes.

You’d still have to edit, but you’d save the time it takes to do something repetitive, which is writing the actual prompt.

It’s even faster than copying and pasting, as you don’t have to switch between windows or files.

**3. DON’T LOSE HOURS OF WORK**

It already happened in the last few months, it may happen again.

Open AI could encounter glitches or bugs that disable the chat history function, and you may lose all the work you have done. Yes, all at once.

So do yourself a favour and export your chats. You can copy and paste the outputs you prefer into a Google Doc or Word file, but if you want to create the back-up file in just one click, it’s pretty easy to do in ChatGPT.

Here is what you have to do:

1. Click on your account in the bottom left corner of the page 2. Click on ‘Settings’

3. Click on ‘Show’, near ‘Data Controls’

4. Click on Export Data at the bottom

5. Confirm the export

**5. The fastest way to grow a company through ChatGPT**

There are many things that need to be in place for maximum growth…

But **feedback from your audience** after a launch is one of the *fastest* ways to do it - yet, one of the most overlooked ones. 🚀

And today we will see a 5-step process where you can leverage AI to grow consistently after all your launches.

Ready?

Then let’s start with number 1…

1. **DIVE INTO BUYER INSIGHTS**

First things first, let's get inside the minds of your amazing buyers.

Reach out to them and find out what made them whip out their credit card and say, 'This is it!'.

This is your opportunity to have meaningful conversations with your customers and understand the key factors that influenced their decision to purchase from you.

Ask them to share 1-3 reasons that resonated with them the most and give them something for free in exchange. These insights will be pure gold, and they’ll be revealing the secret sauce that makes your product or service irresistible to your target audience.

If you don’t feel like coming up with a nice email to write, make ChatGPT write it. You can use this prompt:

*Hi ChatGPT, I want to email my customers and ask them what are the 1-3 reasons why they bought [name of the product].*

*If they answer honestly in exchange I will give them [insert the name and explanation of what you will give them].*

*Can you please write it for me? Make it [adjectives of your tone of voice]*

2. **UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY BEHIND NON-BUYERS**

Now, let's talk about the folks who *didn't* hit that "Buy Now" button.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 27 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Connect with non-buyers and dig deep.

Ask them what stopped you from jumping on board, what doubts or hesitations held them back. And give them something for free in exchange for this info.

This feedback is invaluable as it provides insights into the barriers and objections that prevented conversions. Remember, every objection presents an opportunity for growth.

Want AI to write the email to send? No problem:

*Hi ChatGPT, I want to email my customers and ask them what are the 1-3 reasons why they didn’t buy [name of the product].*

*If they answer honestly in exchange I will give them [insert the name and explanation of what you will give them].*

*Can you please write it for me? Make it [adjectives of your tone of voice]*

3. **BRING IT ALL TOGETHER**

Time to consolidate your findings, my friend!

Copy and paste all those juicy answers (from both buyers and non-buyers) right from your inbox into a Google Doc.

This centralised hub will become your treasure of customer insights.

4.**SUPERCHARGE WITH CHATGPT**

Now it’s time to leverage AI and make ChatGPT summarise the key takeaways from all that valuable feedback. Positive or negative, you'll get a bird's-eye view of what your audience loves and where they need a little extra love.

Here is a prompt you can use:

*Context: I asked my audience (buyers and non buyers) why they did or didn’t buy my [product or service] called [name of the product or service].*

*Here are the answers:*

*[paste from the Google Doc]*

*Now please summarise all the positive and negative things they said about this product.*

NUCLEAR AI FILES 28 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

*Put the insights in a table with two columns: on the left you put the reasons why customers bought, on the right the reasons why people didn’t buy.*

5. **ROCK THE FAQs**

Now that you have this table (you can paste it into a spreadsheet or Google Doc) you can put those insights into action, my friend!

You can ask ChatGPT to generate a list of FAQs based on the buyer motivations and barriers that stopped people from buying.

These FAQs will become your secret weapon, because these are all angles you can use in your landing pages, email sequences, product pages, and so on.

Anticipate those burning questions, address concerns upfront, and watch those sales soar! 🎉

This is how you grow consistently with your audience.

● **Category**: marketing

● **What it helps you with**: get more ideas and

materials to test new

things

● Link to website:

---

When it comes to copywriting and marketing, we all have a good friend on our side: split tests (or tests in general).

It’s kind of fun, right? You test a new version against the best performer, then when you have the new best performer time to test a new version.

Yes, it’s fun, except the fact that when things don’t convert, you’re leaving money on the table 💸 But what if you could optimise all (or a big part) of your marketing assets and test more copy for your promotions?

You would be able to increase your conversion rates, and decrease your cost of acquisition.

How does that sound? 🤑

With AI it’s possible, and I’ll show you how.

1. **TEST NEW COPY VERSIONS**

NUCLEAR AI FILES 30 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Let’s start from ChatGPT.

Something in your funnel is not working? Could be the ad hook, could be the body copy, or maybe the CTA?. Or who knows, maybe the problem lies in the landing page copy.

In these cases the first thing to do would be to test more headlines (in the ad and on the landing page) and CTAs.

Here’s a prompt you can use:

*Hi ChatGPT, my sales funnel is not converting well, and I need to run some tests to get a higher conversion rate.*

*Context:*

*Here is the current [ad/landing page headline/CTA]:*

*[paste your current ad/landing page headline or CTA]*

*Examples:*

*Here are some [ad/landing page headlines/CTAs] that worked for this product previously that I want you to take as example:*

*[paste some examples you want to imitate]*

*Instructions:*

*Create 20 new versions of the current headline. Make them more compelling*

2. **GET SUGGESTIONS ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE BASED ON PERFORMANCE**

Create new high-converting landing pages without a developer? Yup, with .

With this tool, all you need is one prompt, and you get a landing page that is optimised based on thousands of high-converting landing pages.

Permar also analyses your performance, gives you suggestions for improvements and automatically implements those changes.

3. **CREATE AND TEST NEW LEAD MAGNETS**

Testing new lead magnets is a great way to find the best vehicle to get new leads into your email list… and AI is here to help you just with that, because it allows you to take something you have already done and turn it into a new lead magnet.

Here is what you can do:

- choose a topic

- gather the most performing pieces of content you have created on that topic (both long-form and short-form)

- feed ChatGPT with your content multiple times

- edit the final text

- put the text into a Canva template

The first prompt could be:

*You are a high-level marketer specialised in creating lead magnets. I run a business that sells [products or services you offer]. Today I want to create a new lead magnet with the content I already created.*

*Here is a [type of content] I created: [insert content]*

*Rewrite it so that I can use it as a lead magnet*

The following prompts will contain more pieces of content to feed ChatGPT:

*Here is [type of content] I created: [insert content]*

NUCLEAR AI FILES 32 dariuslukas.academy/

*Add the content to the lead magnet you are writing*

40 seconds.

That’s all it took to generate this image using AI:

![](image34%202.png)

The program is called , and the prompt I used was “A samurai riding a horse in a fluorescent forest.”

This image is 100% original and can be used in marketing materials.

*And that’s only the beginning…*

processes very long and detailed prompts that can generate amazing results.

Here’s one example:

NUCLEAR AI FILES 62 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**Prompt:**

*“A summer full of happiness, shinning sun, two tigers facing each other, pixar style bengala tigers, big bright eyes. Wear white gloves on paws, smile happy, delicate and fine, samurai tale, incredibly high detailed, Pixar style, bright colour, Natural light, Simple background with pure color,5 and Octane Render, trending on artstation, Gorgeous,ultra wide angle, 8K,hd realistic, 8K Hd glacier --ar 3:2”*

**Result:**

![](image35%202.png)

When you know how to create high-quality prompts (known as prompt engineering), AI can truly become a partner in your tasks.

Let’s analyse the prompt I used some more:

*“A summer full of happiness, shinning sun”*

👉 AI cannot process emotions, so we need to feed it with the emotional vibe that we are looking for.

*“two tigers facing each other, pixar style bengala tigers, big bright eyes. Wear white gloves on paws, smile happy, delicate and fine, samurai tale”*

👉 Always assume AI is the smartest EXECUTOR (not thinker) in the world. Give it as many precise directions as possible.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 63 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

*“Incredibly high detailed, Pixar style, bright color, Natural light, Simple background with pure color, 5 and Octane Render, trending on artstation, Gorgeous, ultra wide angle, 8K,hd realistic, 8K Hd glacier”*

👉 These are all prompts about the quality of the image and also the setting in which it is created. It is like putting every single detail that’s in your head into paper, so the AI can provide the exact result you’re looking for.

And while Midjourney is not the most user-friendly platform yet, we have already used it to generate creatives for our ads!

**3. The best alternative to Midjourney**

If you’re a digital artist, you might want to try this art generator. 😲

With you can easily create stunning images from text prompts.

The platform offers various models and styles, including oil paintings, anime-like art, cinematic, and more.

It may not be as versatile as other popular text-to-image generators like or , but it's definitely worth exploring.

🤔**How to use NightCafe Studio:**

1. Sign up and select “Create”;

2. Choose a model (DALL -E 3, Stable Video Diffusion, DreamShaper XL Lightning, or Creative Upscaler);

3. Pick a style (cinematic, dark fantasy, 3D game, artistic portrait, etc.); 4. Provide a text prompt;

5. Adjust settings if desired (select the number of images from 1 to 16); 6. Generate the image.

🎨 Here are the prompts that I’ve used:

*PROMPT 1: smiling girl, pastel pink hair, selfie, portrait photography, trendy*

NUCLEAR AI FILES 65 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image36%202.png)

*PROMPT 2: cat looking up, Van Gogh's Starry Night background, color painting*

![](image37%202.png)

*PROMPT 3: surrealist photography, modern, young woman sitting on a giant*

*abstract chair, hair blonde, she is wearing a golden dress, large collar, very detailed*

![](image38%202.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 66 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

You can duplicate any image, allowing you to regenerate it after tweaking the prompt or changing the settings.

Additionally, there’s an option to animate your images.

While you can try this out for free, usually this feature is included with their paid PRO plan.

Therefore, it's important to choose the image carefully and consider whether you really want to animate it, as you might run out of credits.

You can also upscale the model and the size.

An upgrade to this feature is their paid “Creative Upscale” option where you can adjust the creativity level and generate more impressive images.

For example, they transformed a basic prompt that I gave (*smiling girl, pastel pink hair, selfie, portrait photography, trendy)* into this:

*PROMPT 4: smiling girl, pastel pink hair, selfie, portrait photography, trendy head and shoulders portrait, 8k resolution concept art portrait by Greg Rutkowski, Artgerm, WLOP, Alphonse Mucha dynamic lighting hyperdetailed intricately detailed Splash art trending on Artstation triadic colors Unreal Engine 5 volumetric lighting*

![](image39%202.png)

If you want to create a new image, just select **“RESET”**.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 67 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

The platform also has an interactive community where users can share their artwork, participate in challenges, and earn credits.

Wondering about pricing? 💰

NightCafe offers up to **10 free Pro image generations (5 credits)**, allowing users to explore the platform's capabilities before committing to a subscription.

At the moment, you can choose between monthly and annual plans, with prices starting at **$4.49/month for 100 credits.**

![](image40%202.png)

Users can also purchase additional credits as needed, and any credits left unused will roll over to the next month.

That’s pretty cool, as many AI tools simply reset the number of credits at the beginning of the month, regardless of how many you have left.

, , and work in a similar way too.

Now, let’s compare the most diverse ones, which are Pictory, Munch and 2short.

**● THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE CONTENT REPURPOSING AI TOOLS**

:

- This tool is specific for YouTube shorts. Very similar to Clips AI, it finds the most engaging parts of your content and uses it for your shorts, so that you can extend your reach, get more subscribers and grow your YouTube channel faster.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 84 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**This tool is great for people who use a lot of YouTube and want to grow fast.**

:

- The main difference about this tool is that it’s an **all-in-one platform**: Munch provides you with automatic editing, auto-caption generation, post-content creation, and publishing, all within a single, user-friendly tool.
- **Ride the Trends:** Marketers can leverage Munch's trend analysis, which helps identify clips with the highest potential to trend on social media platforms, thereby increasing content visibility. Munch leverages advanced AI

capabilities such as GPT, OCR, and NLP to analyse content and align it with social and marketing trends.

- **AI-Driven Editing:** Munch uses AI to keep the most important content at the centre of each video. This ensures that marketers can create high-impact clips. - **Distil The Context from your Long-form Content:** Munch seems very good at extracting nuggets from lengthy content, providing you with coherent, shareable clips to marketers.

**If you’re looking for a tool that helps you with all the aspects of content in only one place, Munch is the best choice.**

:

- Besides the video editing features we already saw in other tools (cutting engaging parts, captions, titles and so on), Pictory can also turn text, like and , into videos. You just have to copy and paste your text, edit it and in minutes you’ll get an insane output.
- Extract video snippets from sources like Zoom, Teams, and webinars.

You can build your custom branding by giving a new look to your videos -

- Everything runs in the cloud and runs on any computer

**If you are a “writer” person, meaning you like writing scripts, blogs, etc., or you have a lot of written material that you want to use for your video content, Pictory is the perfect tool for you.**

NUCLEAR AI FILES 85 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Of course, each of these tools has a specific price point, that’s something you will have to consider in your choice. You can find everything you need to know on their websites.

I hope this little overview will help you in your lead generation journey!

**BONUS SECTION** 🎁

*Do you have endless amount of audio content? Do THIS!*

Many marketers use podcasting and interviews as vehicles for grabbing attention. Is there a way to leverage that? With you can turn audio files into dynamic short videos.

Curious about how to bring your ideas to life, all while saving time and resources? ⏰I’m going to show you how to automate this process in three simple steps:

**1. Come up with ideas!**💡

We’re going to use ChatGPT to brainstorm some ideas. For that, I’m going to use the following prompt:

**PROMPT:**

*My primary goal with my content is to [describe your goal].*

*I talk about [topic].*

*My target audience is [target audience].*

*Make sure I can turn each idea into a short-form video, considering the following: 1. All content ideas need to be actionable or inspirational.*

*2. They need to include at least 1 number.*

**2. Generate your script!** 📚

Now, let’s create an engaging script!

NUCLEAR AI FILES 139 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**PROMPT:**

*Write a script about[write the idea you selected] for an educational and informative 1-minute video.*

*Format the script as follows:*

- *Hook;*
- *Peak interest by talking about the results they will get; -Discuss solution;*
- *Discuss how to apply the solution;*
- *Call to action.*

*The hook should start with one of the following lines:*

- *Ever wondered how [type of people] are able to generate [result]?*

*Total script should be a maximum of 120 words with extremely conversational tone and casual word choice.*

Ever heard of? It’s one of the most popular AI video generators and is mostly known for its realistic AI avatars.

However, now I’m going to show you 3 features that are absolutely mind blowing (*and not many people know about*)!

1. Make an AI clone of yourself;

2. Instantly change the language that you’re speaking in; 3. Talking photo generation.

Let’s start from the beginning!

HeyGen offers hundreds of AI avatars, voices and templates for various use cases, such as product marketing, content marketing, sales outreach, etc**.**

**How to use HeyGen to create a video:**

1. Click "Create Video" at the top right.

2. Choose an avatar, for example "Briana".

NUCLEAR AI FILES 147 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image129.png)

3. Add your script: you can choose **Text Script** or **Audio Script**. 4. Adjust speed and pitch.

5. Click "Play" to preview.

6. "Submit" to publish.

It’s as simple as that.

Now, let’s delve into the mind-blowing features I teased you about!

**#1 Make an AI clone of yourself**🤖

![](image130.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 148 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

To create your own AI avatar with HeyGen, you'll need a professional camera shooting at 4K resolution, a greenscreen, and good lighting (*follow the recording guidelines explained* ).

After you finish recording, email the footage to the HeyGen team for review.

Upon approval, you can use your custom avatar on any video you create using HeyGen.

**Once you've created your AI avatar, you can make it speak using the Voice Cloning feature!**

It supports eight languages: English, German, Polish, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and Hindi.

To clone your voice, go to the "Voice" menu, click "Clone Voice," and follow two simple steps: "Record Consent" and "Record Voice."

The process takes about two minutes.

I believe this feature really sets them apart from other AI video generators. ✨**#2. Record in one language, translate in 40+ languages**🌐

You can record in over 40 languages, such as Arabic, Indonesian, Polish, Tamil, etc. All you have to do is upload your video or paste a Google Drive / YouTube video URL, choose the language in which you want to translate your video, and select the number of speakers.

Then select “Translate your video” and “Download” it.

**#3 Talking Photo**📸🗣️

HeyGen's TalkingPhoto feature lets you animate any photo and add a human voice in over 100 languages and accents.

Just provide a script, and HeyGen will bring your image to life!

On the HeyGen dashboard, select “Make a TalkingPhoto Video”.

Whether you're drafting emails, brainstorming blog ideas, or crafting social media ads, this AI tool can be super helpful.

![](image168.png)

Let’s see how it works.

looks a lot like Google Docs. To begin, create a new document and then select the AI features you want to use from the menu on the left.

🔧**Here’s how it works:**

**1. Select language** 🌐

You can choose from over 30 languages.

**2. Tone of voice** 🎵

NUCLEAR AI FILES 183 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**5. Generate variations** ✨

Choose how many variations you want Ryte to generate (1-3) and select the creativity level (e.g., optimal / none / medium / high).

**6. Ryte for me** ✍️

Keep generating variations until you achieve the desired outcome.

Let’s say you want to generate a **Blog Idea & Outline** on the topic "What is affiliate marketing?". In that case, you would choose the "informative" tone and set the creativity to "optimal".

After generating the content, you have options like "Change Tone",

"Improve/Rephrase", "Change Length", or "Insert Content" for further adjustments.

![](image171.png)

🔍If you wish to insert new content and add a paragraph, simply select the text. Here’s an example:

As entrepreneurs, marketers and service providers, investing in ourselves is always on the top of our list, right?

And what does everyone mention in these cases?

Courses… Mentors… *Books*

Yes, books. That’s what we are talking about today.

Because as much as we like reading them, time is still a scarce resource. ⏳

But, what if we could ‘download’ books into our minds in just minutes?

*No, you don’t have to wire your brain to a new tool as if it was an episode of Black Mirror!*

Yet, with AI we can cut down a big chunk of the time it takes to read a book (and re-read, when we like it).

We can even get summaries so that we can decide if we want to read the whole book or not.

So let’s break down 4 ways you can get the knowledge from all the books you want in just minutes with AI 📚

**1. Turn a book into easily digestible content** 📑

NUCLEAR AI FILES 189 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

You don’t have time to read a whole book, and prefer a 15-minute video or audio instead?

Or maybe a short text that you can read with your morning coffee?

Then is what you need.

![](image175.png)

CEOs, founders, leaders, and sales professionals use this tool to *take the best-selling business and personal development books, and summarise the big ideas into 15 minute videos you can watch with your team, audio you can listen to on the go, and text that you can read while you drink your morning coffee.* (readshark.com)

You can try it for free, before paying for the subscription.

This could be very useful when you haven’t read a specific book yet, but also when you have already read it.

But the best thing is that when you grow thanks to a book, you can easily share it with others, and they grow too.

**2. Learn about the book content 10x faster**

Here are 3 things you can do to learn about the content of a book faster:

 1. Ask questions and get answers about a book

 2. Get complicated concepts explained like you were a 5 year-old  3. Compare books between each other

NUCLEAR AI FILES 190 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Lucky for us, does all these 3 things together. And you just have to sign up for free to use it!

![](image176.png)

![](image177.png)

**3. Keep your takeaways in a table** 📅

Let’s say you have just finished reading an incredible business book, but you don’t like taking notes because you don't want to feel like it’s high-school again. It would be very useful to create a slick table with **all takeaways for your specific needs**.

Here is how you can do it:

NUCLEAR AI FILES 191 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

1. Give this prompt to ChatGPT:

*I need your help to break down the key takeaways from the book "[book* *title]" by [author] and how I can implement those same takeaways to my* *specific situation.*

*Here is my situation: [explain what is your problem and what you are struggling with, and what help you need from the book]*

*Follow these instructions:*

*1. Please present all the key lessons from the book as they apply to my situation in a table format.*

*2. Please use the following columns:*

*1) Key takeaway*

*2) Brief Explanation*

*3) Where I can find the takeaway in the book*

*4) Strategy I need to apply (tailored to my situation)*

*5) List of action steps*

*Thank you!*

2. Copy and paste the table into the first cell of a Google Spreadsheet or Excel file (whatever you feel more comfortable with)

3. Adjust the cells to make the file as beautiful as you want (size of the cells, colour, font, etc.)

4. Turn the cell into a PDF file (save it as a PDF format), if you want.

Et voilà! You have a slick table with all the best takeaways, strategies, and action steps from your book.

You can keep it for the future, share it with other people with your same goal, and do whatever you want with it.

**4. Find your next book to study with AI** 📚

Having fun reading books this way? Then why don’t you find the next books to read and enjoy with AI?

YouTube channel with

less effort

**● Link to website:**

As you probably have already heard, a YouTube channel is a great way to drive free traffic to your offers.

Yet, as an entrepreneur it’s difficult to find the time to do it properly.

If you want to leverage YouTube more often and create a new video in 1/10 of the time with AI, then this section is for you.

I am about to give you a ***simple* and *fast* step-by-step process** that goes from the very beginning (finding the video idea) to preparing for the next video.

I’ll give you all the prompts and tools you need.

On top of that, most of this process will be free of charge!

NUCLEAR AI FILES 193 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

**STEP 1 - IDENTIFY THE TOPIC OF THE VIDEO** 📑

First of all, let’s find the right topic. How? We analyse what the audience of our competitors say, so that we find out what they want.

We do this in two steps.

First, we use an AI tool called . You simply need to copy and paste the link of your competitor’s YouTube video and it generates an Excel spreadsheet with the list of the comments.

![](image178.png)

We do this because under YouTube videos people give opinions, ask for more content, share what they loved most about the video. Hence, it’s a great resource.

Then we go to ChatGPT and write this prompt:

*I have a list of comments and reviews. I want you to analyse this list and create a new list with sentences, phrases and topics that people repeat over and over in their comments. List them from most common to not common.*

For this step, choose competitor’s videos with 100-500 comments, so that it’s not too hard for ChatGPT to process the list. Repeat this process with 5-10 videos and you’ll have a clear idea of the topics you can talk about. Then make your choice.

**STEP 2 - TURN THE TOPIC INTO AN IDEA** 💡

NUCLEAR AI FILES 194 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Have you chosen your topic? Great! Now we can turn it into a clear video idea. We do this through .

All you have to do is enter your topic, a search term, tone of voice and language.

![](image179.png)

**STEP 3 - WRITE THE VIDEO SCRIPT** 🖊

With the topic and video idea in place, it's time to create the video script. And for this we’ll use our friend ChatGPT.

Here is a prompt you can use:

*Act like an expert YouTube content creator with long experience in [insert your niche] videos.*

*I want to write a YouTube video script about [topic] to [goal].*

*Write an engaging and high-converting video script.*

*Make sure you mention [concepts].*

*Don’t mention [concepts].*

*The call to action is [your call to action].*

Then, as always, you can give it more prompts to increase the quality of the output. Some prompt examples are:

*Make it shorter*

NUCLEAR AI FILES 195 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

*Make it more engaging*

*Make it catchier*

*Make it longer*

*Rewrite the transition and make it clearer*

Once you have a good output, you do the final edits, and you have your YouTube video script.

You just have to shoot your video now (yes, you can deepfake your way out of it… it’s up to you, but if you want to connect with your audience my suggestion is to keep this part ‘human’).

**STEP 4 - WRITE A SEO-FRIENDLY TITLE AND DESCRIPTION** 🔍

Once you have a draft of your video script, it's time to write a SEO-friendly YouTube title and description.

There are very useful tools you can try for this, like , but since our aim is to cut the time required, we’ll rely on ChatGPT once again.

Keep working in the same chat you used for the video script, and use this prompt:

*Now I want to write an effective YouTube title and description for my video. Make sure they are SEO-friendly.*

Now you have your video, with title and description.

Before posting it, make sure you do it in the best time for your audience. If you don’t know how to do it, ask ChatGPT for instructions:

*Give me a step-by-step process to find when is the best time to post my new YouTube video*

**STEP 5 - EXTRACT COMMENTS TO GET IDEAS FOR THE NEXT VIDEOS** 🔄

Let’s say you repeat this process 10 times. Now you have ten videos, which means you will have a certain amount of comments.

You can use the same AI tool we used before () to create a spreadsheet with all the topics people talk about under your videos.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 196 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

This way you have incredible data about your audience and you have free ideas for your next videos. 📈

**But wait, there’s more!**

What if you have a YouTube channel and you're struggling with low traffic and views despite posting content daily, it can be discouraging.

Low growth often leads to a lack of motivation and enthusiasm for creating videos, causing many creators to give up on YouTube early on.

diagrams

● **Link to website**:

Let me walk you through an interesting tool that allows you to explore any topic with AI.

It’s called - which is not to be mistaken with Albus AI (another interesting AI tool).

is an AI tool that allows you to explore a topic and explain it through text and images, organising all the information visually on a board.

![](image221.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 243 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

I played with it, and I want to share with you the most interesting functionalities you can find in this beta AI platform, and how you can use them for your business.

Keep in mind, I won’t describe all the functionalities, but just the ones that are most interesting for you and your business. If you want to dig in more, you should take some time to explore it further.

**1. How to start using Albus**

As you can see in , everything starts from the topic or question that you type in the search box at the top of the board.

From there, on the left will appear a colourful menu with subtopics to explore.

![](image222.png)

What can we write in the search box?

As marketers and business owners, the best thing we can do is write about a problem you have in your company (like ‘My team is not cooperating well’), the problem your target audience has, or a topic that is the focus of our method, products or approach (like ‘women losing weight through weight training’).

This way you can solve your company’s problems, find new ideas for your content, and dig into your audience’s mind.

When you click on one of the subtopics on the left, a box will appear on the board, and you will find some deeper info about what you asked for.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 244 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Now let’s see the different ways you can use Albus for your business.

**2. Find new perspectives**

When you play with this tool you will find it does an amazing job giving you new perspectives and angles. And of course, this is great for your copy angles and content topics.

You have many ways to do it:

Once a subtopic has been created by AI, click on the ‘+’ that appears on the side of a box. You will have to chance to click on ‘Tell me more’ options

![](image223.png)

● Ask a question through the ‘Smart text option’. On the right menu, there is an option that allows you to get answers to your questions about that topic. So if you are working with this tool and you think of a question, you can do it easily.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 245 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image224.png)

● If you see a good point covered in one of the outputs, you can copy and

paste that part in another text element, and ask the tool to expand on

that point, make it simpler or provide a new perspective. To create a text

box, you just have to click on the ‘A’ on the right menu.

![](image225.png)

If you are looking for the solution to a problem, these functionalities allow you to find the root of that problem, while if you are looking for ideas for content and copy these new perspectives will help you open your mind.

**3. Find out the common mistakes**

Whether you are focusing on a problem or on a topic for your copy and content, this function is very useful, because you can find the most common mistakes people make about a certain topic.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 246 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

On the left menu, you can switch from ‘explore’ to ‘teach’. Once you have done that you can click on ‘Common mistakes’. Select ‘adult education’ in the box that appears at the top.

![](image226.png)

**4. Find more about your audience**

As you can see in the picture above, this tool allows you to go deeper into the real-life benefits.

You just need to click on ‘Real-life benefits’ in the ‘teach’ menu.

But it doesn’t end here. Another trick you can use to get to know your audience and their feelings better is using the ‘Expand it’ function.

Like I showed you before, you just need to copy a sentence from a previous output, paste it into a new text box, and expand it by clicking on the ‘+’ that appears on the side.

Do it a couple of times and you might find yourself with ideas, phrases and feelings you hadn't thought of.

As you can see, this tool has a lot of potential.

Do you know one of the great things about AI?

It can take something we already do regularly and give you ideas to make it work better.

And I’m not just talking about marketing ideas.

In this section you will find a few ways you can use AI to help you improve what you already have and do in your business.

**1.** The first thing to mention is an AI tool called, and let me tell you, if you have a lot of phone/online conversations with your customers, you need this.

It’s based on a simple principle: conversations with customers are insanely valuable for business growth, yet very few people have the time to review them properly and get valuable insights.

That’s exactly where Flai comes in.

This tool helps businesses summarise conversations, get an overview of the most frequent topics, and find what needs to be improved in your products, so that you can have more happy customers and grow your revenue faster.

**2.** The second way AI uses what we already have to help us improve is through our most valuable asset: our teams.

is a tool that helps people in teams connect better through AI.

How? It identifies who might be isolated and needs some help connecting better, measuring employee engagement.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 248 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

Let’s say two of your employees don't communicate much. This AI-powered tool finds the things these two people have in common, their shared interests will connect them better and make them more cohesive in their work.

And we both know that more cohesive companies grow faster and better.

Even better, Glue gives you measurable results for your budget! 📈

**3.** The third thing you can do to use AI to work with what you already have is something that would take a little more work, but in some cases could have a really high ROI.

Let’s explain this with a real-life business example.

Job van der Voort, CEO and co-founder of , trained AI for the specific needs of his company.

You see, he runs a platform for businesses of all sizes to hire and pay remote workers from anywhere. This business model involves employing people in dozens of countries. So as a business they need to be able to quickly respond to questions about the regulations in each of those locations.

That’s why they trained an AI bot with country-specific expertise and local knowledge.

Their internal ChatGPT is a total wizard at knowing each country's specific laws, and now they don't need to waste hours digging through loads of boring paperwork to find the juicy bits about a particular country's laws anymore. They just type their question into their own internal tool and within seconds, they get a straight-up accurate answer.

Now, I understand this last “trick” is harder to implement, because you will probably need to hire an AI developer. But for many companies it would still be a no brainer for the ROI it generates.

This is exactly how AI is meant to be implemented: to take the tedious tasks off our shoulders and allow us to focus on the needle movers of our businesses.

**9. 3 ways to get unstuck through AI**

● **AI Tool**: multiple

● **Category**: brainstorming ● **What it helps you with**: getting more ideas to

improve what you

produce

**● Link to website:**

As a marketer, business owner or freelancer, there is a sensation you are probably familiar with.

*That feeling of being stuck*⛓

You know when we can't come up with a fresh idea for a product, a campaign, a strategy for a launch…

Or maybe you plateaued in your growth…

Well, fear not, as AI can help you get unstuck in more ways than you may think. In this section, we will explore 4 **powerful ways AI can help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals easier.**

**1. Coming up with a new email strategy**

Let’s say you have been testing various email strategies but nothing seems to really work.

You have tried everything the gurus said, but still no results.

How do you get unstuck? Try writing a ChatGPT prompt outlined this way:

● Objective of the email strategy

● Context

● Target Market

● Unique Value Proposition of your product or service

● Details of the product or service

NUCLEAR AI FILES 250 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

● Short list of the guidelines ChatGPT needs to follow for this strategy - like the number of emails, if you want it to write the sequence, etc.

It will take some time to write this kind of prompt, but it’s definitely effective to overcome the plateau 📊

**2. Ask Jeff Bezos some insights about your audience**📖

As you probably already know, Amazon is a great place to find useful information about your audience's feelings and thoughts.

This is an easy and fast way to get unstuck.

So, why not have ChatGPT “take” information from Amazon and give it to you in a fraction of the time? Here’s how you do it:

● Identify the number 1 book or audiobook your avatar would read or listen to ● Ask ChatGPT to do a summary of the reviews of that book

● Ask ChatGPT to make a list of the top 10 problems that book helped overcome according to reviewers

**3. Use scientific research to find new ideas and angles**

When you’re feeling stuck during the creation process, I have found diving into scientific research data really dig myself out.

Have you ever noticed there is research on virtually anything? Yes, it’s true… and it is funny - and VERY useful for us.

But since going through all the scientific research is very time consuming, we should take advantage of an AI tool called .

This is a search engine that uses AI to extract and distil findings directly from scientific research.

With Consensus finding scientific data will be easy like a Google search.

angles

**● Link to website:**

---

Do you use scientific research for your campaigns?

You read that right, we are talking about *scientific research*.

When you use this kind of data in your marketing and branding, be it on websites, landing pages, or videos, your claims are more credible and persuasive.

Because data is proof that something is true, that’s why so many companies use it.

But… finding the right research paper and extracting the data you are looking for can be pretty hard and time-consuming.

Well, not anymore with AI! There are lots of tools that you can use today to streamline this process and use the right data in your marketing 📈

So in this section I am going to break down a process you can use to leverage AI to find the scientific data you need for your next strategy.

**1. FIND THE RIGHT PIECE OF RESEARCH** 🔬

The first step is finding the right piece of research. While Google would help us really slowly with this, AI search tools can help you to get it done in a fraction of the time.

There are 3 AI tools I personally love:

NUCLEAR AI FILES 252 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

1.

![](image227.png)

2.

![](image228.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 253 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

3.

![](image229.png)

These are the tools that could *possibly* replace Google search, according to experts.

Because they scour the internet and give a condensed summary of what they find in a digestible way, without you having to open dozens of tabs looking for the right information.

Since there is a lot of research on many topics, at this stage my suggestion would be to use all these tools and get as much information as possible – you can also take a look at the references these tools provide to get more in depth with the data. Then copy and paste the best findings into a Google or Word Document.

**2. UNDERSTAND INFORMATION BETTER** 📑

Now you have in front of you a document that contains all the information you need. But the problems are:

1. you don’t know which is the best data to use

2. the language probably isn’t very simple to understand, as most research papers aren’t very good at that

NUCLEAR AI FILES 254 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

So how do we solve this? We turn the Google Doc into a PDF, and use AI tools like or to… chat with the file, ask questions and understand the content better.

![](image230.png)

![](image231.png)

**3. CREATE YOUR MESSAGE** 🔊

The third step is to take the information you gathered from the last two steps, and use ChaGPT to use it in your copy and marketing strategy in an effective way.

Here’s a prompt you can use:

NUCLEAR AI FILES 255 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

*Act like a branding and marketing expert, with decades of experience in the [niche].I have found this useful piece of research: [insert piece of research].*

*Write a persuasive [type of copy] using this piece of data.*

If you don’t know where to use the data you have found, here’s another prompt you can use:

*I have found a piece of research that says [piece of data].*

*I want to use this data to promote my [type of products]. Where can I use it?*

This tool allows you to paste the URL of 1500+ platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, TED Talks, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, and more, and receive the transcript of the content.

And more than offering a transcript, you also get access to some cool AI features!

Here’s what you get with :

🔖**Relevant sections:** Easily find sections where specific topics were discussed.

💬 **Contextual Q&A:** Receive answers from the transcript, with precise references using their “Ask ChatGPT” feature.

🎙️**Speaker identification:** The AI automatically assigns labels to multiple speakers, so you know who said what.

🚀**How it works:**

*(The maximum duration for the FREE trial is 30 minutes)* 2. Select the output language.

3. Choose whether to make the transcript Private, Public or Unlisted.

5. Transcribe!

![](image243.png)

NUCLEAR AI FILES 267 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

🔍 I decided to test this tool using one of Darius’ YouTube videos: *“How to Effectively Learn AI in 2024 (4-Step Guide for Beginners)”*.

![](image244.png)

In just around 2 minutes, it generated an accurate transcript.

Next, I explored its AI features: I extracted the “Topics”.

And it showed me the exact topics that were discussed in the video: *“AI for Small Businesses”, “AI Tools”, “Learning AI”, “Community for AI Beginners”,* and *“AI Basics: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LLMs”*.

NUCLEAR AI FILES 268 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

![](image245.png)

Then, I decided to “Generate Tweets”.

And here are the tweets it generated:

*Tweet 1:* 🚀 *Are you a small business owner ready to level up with AI? Discover the 80-20 of AI tools that yield a high ROI on your time. No tech expertise required!*

*#AIforBusiness #SmallBusiness #Entrepreneur*

*Tweet 2:* 🔍 *Step 1: Identify the goal of your AI journey. What area of your business do you want to automate with AI? This step is crucial for achieving results. Learn more in this video. #AIJourney #BusinessAutomation #AIforSmallBusiness*

*#NoCodeAI #TimeSavingTools*

🤔 I also wanted to try the feature “Generate Blog Post”, and I must say, it did a pretty good job.

Here’s some lines it generated:

*For small business owners, the thought of diving into the world of AI can be daunting. The good news is, you don't need to be a tech expert to leverage AI for your business. In this blog post, I'll guide you through a four-step process to learn AI effectively and efficiently.*

**Step 1: Define Your AI Goals**

NUCLEAR AI FILES 269 dariuslukas.academy/

![](image2%206.png)

*Before diving into the world of AI, it's crucial to identify the specific areas of your business that could benefit from automation and AI integration. Consider the following questions:*

*● What tasks do you want to automate with AI?*

*● Do you want to streamline content creation, copywriting, video editing, or* *other specific areas of your business?*

*Having a clear understanding of your AI goals will set the foundation for the next steps in your AI journey.*

While it did misspell some words, like the name of certain AI tools, it provides a good starting point for a future blog post.

Another AI feature is the ability to create quizzes to engage your audience. From the 9-minute video I selected, it generated a 6-question quiz.
