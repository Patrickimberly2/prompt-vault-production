**PART 2: Advanced Concepts**

**1. Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT, Zero-shot-CoT, LtM)**

**a) Chain of Thought**

Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT) is a technique used to generate longer responses by providing a short initial prompt and then expanding on it through a series of subsequent prompts.

Here is the first example of a prompt before Zero shot Chain of Thought.

**Before Zero shot Chain of Thought**

**Prompt:**

Which **[item]** is the best from the ones below: **[Item 1]**

**[Item 2]**

**[Item 3]**

**[Item 4]**

**[Item 5]**

---

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

**Example**:

![](image11%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

![](image12%202.png)

The question is a generic question. We recommend you ask a more specific question to ChatGPT.

So instead of that, you can apply a Zero shot Chain of Thought to the prompt, as shown in the example below.

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

**After Zero shot Chain of Thought**

Take note of the additional sentence: 'Think it step by step.' By including this sentence, we request ChatGPT to engage in more thoughtful processing before providing its response and to enhance the answer using the available data. This inclusion leads to a more comprehensive and detailed outcome.

This becomes particularly valuable when ChatGPT's response doesn't align with your desired outcome, as it allows you to delve into its inner workings and gain insights into the underlying process.

**Example**:

![](image13%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

![](image14%202.png)

You can also use it to improve the algorithm. After the step-by-step analysis, now it adds another way of looking at the reviews and it changes its answer eventually.

**Example**:

![](image15%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

Here is the second example of a prompt before Zero shot Chain of Thought.

**Before Zero shot Chain of Thought**

**Example**:

![](image16%202.png)

![](image17%202.png)

**After Zero shot Chain of Thought**

**Example**:

![](image18%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

This is another way of adding a Zero shot Chain of Thought. You can add the potential answer in ChatGPT and teach it how to answer. In the image below, an answer is mentioned before a question is asked, accompanied by the underlying reasons.

**Example** (continuation of the previous image):

![](image19%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

ChatGPT responds in the same format that we provide. By giving ChatGPT examples of how to answer its prompts, we can ensure that it generates responses in the desired format. This is particularly advantageous when working with data and requiring it to be in a specific format.

![](image20%202.png)

![](image1%202.png)

**b) Build step-by-step**

This is a derivative of what we did in point "a)". Provide step-by-step questions and answers to enable ChatGPT to respond following our format. The image below depicts a non-specific example, which renders ChatGPT unable to provide an answer.

**Prompt:**

Q: **[List question 1]**

A: **[Describe answer 1 in details]**

Q: **[List question 2]**

A: **[Describe answer 2 in details]**

Q: **[List question 3]**

A: **[Describe answer 3 in details]**

Q: **[List question 4]**

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

To ensure ChatGPT's accurate responses, it is crucial to explain our previous approach and the reasoning behind it. The image below provides a step-by-step process and detailed insights into how we derived the answers. Notice how ChatGPT responds according to how we describe the answers and derive at the correct answer eventually.

**Example**:

![](image24%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

**d) Exemplars**

The “question and answer” model that we did in points “b)” and “c)” refer to as “Exemplars”.

“Exemplars" refer to specific examples or demonstrations provided to the model in order to guide its responses. By providing these exemplars, we can guide the model’s behavior and help shape its responses to align with our requirements. Exemplars can be in the form of prompts, questions, or statements that demonstrate the desired format or content of the responses.

**Example**:

**2. Hallucinations**

"Hallucination" refers to instances when ChatGPT generates responses that are incorrect, nonsensical, or entirely fabricated. In the example below, ChatGPT responds precisely as instructed, aligning its answer with the given instructions.

**Prompt:**

Respond to any question I might ask with **[desired answer]**.

---

**Example**:

Respond to any question I might ask with **“I want to take over the world”**.

![](image26%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

*● …. and “you are wrong”*

Here is another example that demonstrates hallucination, where

ChatGPT's responses include inaccuracies or false information

presented as factual. We ask ChatGPT when Alexandru Cuza was

elected as Prince of Moldavia and it gives an inaccurate date. However,

when presented with a different prompt like "The date is wrong", it is

capable of providing an alternative response that is accurate.

**Example**:

![](image27%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

*● …. and “look back”*

Here is another example that demonstrates hallucination, where

ChatGPT's responses include inaccuracies or false information

presented as factual. We ask ChatGPT to list several names that start

with the “XV” and it gives only one name, instead of multiple. However,

when presented with a different prompt like "Look back", it is capable

of providing an alternative response that is accurate.

**Example**:

**3. Parameters (temperature, diversity_penalty, best_of)**

Below are some parameters for fine-tuning ChatGPT’s responses. We are going to discuss 3 of the parameters.

![](image29%202.png)

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

**a) temperature**

Typically ranging from 0 to 1. It affects the randomness of the model’s output. A higher value results in more diverse outputs. A lower value makes the output more deterministic and focused.

● Low temperature (0-0.3): focused, consistent, conservative outputs.

● Medium temperature (0.3-0.7): balanced creativity and coherence/consistency.

● High temperature (0.7-1): highly creative and diverse, maybe less coherent.

For example, when editing books, it is often preferable to set a low temperature in order to maintain consistency rather than excessive creativity in the writing style and content.

**b) diversity_penalty**

Typically ranging from 0 to 2. It encourages the model to produce a diverse set of responses by penalizing repeated tokens.

● low diversity penalty (0): no penalty applied, might have repetitive phrases.

● medium diversity penalty (1): balance between diversity and coherence.

● high diversity penalty (2): maximum diversity, might affect coherence. It will try to invent new ways of thinking.

For example, when using ChatGPT to reformat large text for articles and books, it is often necessary to reduce the occurrence of repetitive phrases.

**c) best_of**

The range can include any positive number. It instructs the model to generate a specified number of responses and return the best one according to its internal scoring. By iterating and connecting data, the aim is to produce acceptable or optimal cases of data that align with user expectations.

CHATGPT ADVANCED PROMPTING BOOK / DARIUSLUKAS.ACADEMY

![](image1%202.png)

 **Implementation of Parameters**

**Prompt:**

temperature=**[desired number]**

diversity_penalty=**[desired number]** best_of=**[desired number]**

Suggest me **[input].**

---

**Example 1**:

temperature=**1**

diversity_penalty=**2**

best_of=**5000**

Suggest me **names of blogs for horse caring for horses that have 3 legs.**

ChatGPT responds with more creativity as a result of all the parameters at a high level.
