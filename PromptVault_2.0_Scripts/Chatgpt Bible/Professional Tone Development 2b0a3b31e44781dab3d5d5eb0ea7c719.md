# Professional Tone Development

### FILL-IN-THE-BLANK **PROMPTS:**

```jsx
I want to ensure my tone is **[specific, e.g., professional, approachable]** 
when writing emails. Provide examples of how to adjust my tone for different 
audiences.
```

```jsx
Here’s a message with a specific tone of voice: **[insert original message]**. 
I need you to craft a new message using the same tone and style. The new 
message should feel just as natural and consistent as the original, while 
adapting to the following context: **[insert new context or topic]**.
```

```jsx
My responses sometimes come across as **[specific concern, e.g., too formal, 
overly casual]**. Please rephrase this to balance professionalism with 
friendliness: **[insert message].**
```
